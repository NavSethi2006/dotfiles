# Navin's DOTFILES

My first attempt at a wayland rice. It uses hyperland, waybar, wofi and some other software

# How To Install

```
git clone https://github.com/NavSethi2006/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
chmod 777 install.sh
sh install.sh
```

Its as simple as that

# Some shortcuts required to know

- mod+r : open wofi (application menu)
- mod+w : close active window
- mod+q : open terminal

These are essentials shortcuts

Enjoy Using my rice setup :)
